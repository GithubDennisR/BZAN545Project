# BZAN545Project
Project Repo for BZAN 545 Project

1. First, we uploaded a contract defining the rules and roles pertaining to our group members in order to get tasks completed and pushed to github.

2. Next, we did our initial commit for our project's data code which comprised taking the url containing the data then creating an object out of it to store the data specifically in an object.

3. Then, we created a table out of the data and identified column headers: Salesdate, ProductID, Region, Freeship, Discount, and Itemssold.

4. Next, we appended the data to .csv and read in the data table.

5. Then, we created a force script in order for data to be updated even if a day is missed in the task scheduler.

6. Next, we set up and polished everything in accordance with task scheduler/CRON.

7. After, we developed code to push our retrieved data to postgres SQL database within Saxon's server.

8. Then, we crafted our initial project presentation slides discussing our progress and ideas at that time to discuss with the class.

9. Next, we created a dashboard along with dataframe by utilizing dash and visuals created from plotly. The initial creation of the app involves pulling our desired external stylesheet.

10. Then, we added an append data python script to truncate the datatable and add the data to the SQL server.

11. After, we uploaded html files to templates.

12. Then, implemented the flask app and pushed it to main.

13. Finally, we used CSS and JSON to create the dash application inside of the flask app.
